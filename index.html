	<p>Because of their family, Victor and Victoria had an arranged marriage. Before their marriage, Victor was practicing his lines in a forest. However, there was a deceased young woman who woke up from the dead. Her name is Emily, and she was murdered on her wedding day. She assumed that he had said the wedding vows to her. Not only that, but she had fallen in love with him. In that case, she brought him to the "Land of the Dead". Why? Well, Emily wanted to be married with him. Since Victoria was worried, she had been trying to search for him until he comes back.</p>

<center><h3 style="color: #243d5c">My Honest Review:</h3></center>
<center><p>If I have to be honest, it is a very good movie. Not only does it show a heartful story, but it has a meaning to it. The character designs are creating a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. Since it was made by Tim Burton, it has dark humour and jokes. It is a good teenage movie to watch with your friends or family. It shows emotions such as love or loss, which give the viewers sincere feelings. I am happy that i got the opportunity to watch it because it is much more of a mature storyline.
